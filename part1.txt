Part 1: Discussion Questions

Recursion

1. In your own words, what is recursion?
Recursion is when a function calls itself, makes a progression, and ends at its
base case.

2. Why is it necessary to have a base case?
Else, the function will run an infinite loop.  It needs something to stop at.

Graphs

1. What is a graph?
A graph is a structure containing nodes that are connected by edges and looped
together.

2. How is a graph different from a tree?
A tree doesn't contain loops.

3. Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
The water cycle.
